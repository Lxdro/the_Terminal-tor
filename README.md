# The Terminal-tor

An educational and immersive way to learn terminal commands, created for the **Swift Student Challenge 2025**. ðŸŽ‰

## Description

**The Terminal-tor** is a gamified learning experience designed to teach essential terminal commands through interactive levels. Inspired by the *"do it yourself"* philosophy, the app encourages users to experiment, problem-solve, and learn by doingâ€”just like real developers reading documentation to understand new tools.

From guided button-based interactions to full command-line input, the difficulty scales progressively, making it accessible to beginners while still offering a challenge for more experienced users.
